1) Initial port to Cytoscape 3
	 The idea is to just get the basic functionality moved over.  We can 
	 clean up where it makes sense, but we want to avoid any major
	 refactoring.

2) Prototype REST communication
	 Eventually, we hope that REST will be part of the Cytoscape core,
	 but until then, we should feel free to prototype our own.  This
	 will allow us to avoid having to do much in the way of cleaning up
	 the pipe communication.

3) Complete prototype "Create network from structure" functionality
