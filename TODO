1) Initial port to Cytoscape 3
	 The idea is to just get the basic functionality moved over.  We can 
	 clean up where it makes sense, but we want to avoid any major
	 refactoring.

2) Prototype REST communication
	 Eventually, we hope that REST will be part of the Cytoscape core,
	 but until then, we should feel free to prototype our own.  This
	 will allow us to avoid having to do much in the way of cleaning up
	 the pipe communication.

3) Complete prototype "Create network from structure" functionality


Major design changes:
-> structureManager and chimeraManager replace all classes that were 
responsible for communication between Cytoscape and Chimera. Currently, they 
have references to each other, but structureManager is the context object 
moved around.
-> structureManager has a mapping of cyObjects to Structure objects, 
structure settings, dialogs, ...
-> chimeraManager has a mapping of model numbers to open models, the Chimera 
process, the listener threads (which get a reference to the StructureManager 
to be able to pass changes).
=> We need to decide how and if to divide the roles of the structureManager and 
chimeraManager mainly in cases of selection, model changes (currently in the 
StructureMaanger) and sending commands (currently only in the chimeraManaegr).  
-> Structure is a container for two-directional mapping between Cytoscape and 
Chimera objects.
=> How to handle sub-models?
=> Move code that parses CHimera output to one place.
